data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0002.wav,"Not at this particular case, Tom, apologized Whittemore."
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0003.wav,For the twentieth time that evening the two men shook hands.
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0004.wav,"Lord, but I'm glad to see you again, Phil."
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0005.wav,Will we ever forget it.
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0006.wav,"God bless 'em, I hope I'll go on seeing them forever."
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0007.wav,And you always want to see it in the superlative degree.
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0008.wav,"Gad, your letter came just in time."
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0009.wav,"He turned sharply, and faced Gregson across the table."
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0010.wav,I'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game.
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0011.wav,If I ever needed a fighter in my life I need one now.
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0012.wav,Gregson shoved back his chair and rose to his feet.
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0013.wav,"He was a head shorter than his companion, of almost delicate physique."
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0014.wav,"Now you're coming down to business, Phil, he exclaimed."
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0015.wav,It's the aurora borealis.
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0016.wav,"There's Fort Churchill, a rifle-shot beyond the ridge, asleep."
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0017.wav,From that moment his friendship for Belize turns to hatred and jealousy.
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0018.wav,There was a change now.
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0019.wav,"I followed the line of the proposed railroad, looking for chances."
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0020.wav,Clubs and balls and cities grew to be only memories.
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0021.wav,It fairly clubbed me into recognizing it.
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0022.wav,Hardly were our plans made public before we were met by powerful opposition.
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0023.wav,A combination of Canadian capital quickly organized and petitioned for the same privileges.
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0024.wav,It was my reports from the north which chiefly induced people to buy.
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0025.wav,I was about to do this when cooler judgment prevailed.
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0026.wav,It occurred to me that there would have to be an accounting.
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0027.wav,To my surprise he began to show actual enthusiasm in my favor.
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0029.wav,Their forces were already moving into the north country.
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0030.wav,I had faith in them.
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0031.wav,They were three hundred yards apart.
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0032.wav,Since then some mysterious force has been fighting us at every step.
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0033.wav,"He unfolded a long typewritten letter, and handed it to Gregson."
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0034.wav,Men of Selden's stamp don't stop at women and children.
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0035.wav,"He stopped, and Philip nodded at the horrified question in his eyes."
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0036.wav,She turned in at the hotel.
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0037.wav,I was the only one who remained sitting.
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0038.wav,We'll have to watch our chances.
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0039.wav,The ship should be in within a week or ten days.
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0040.wav,I suppose you wonder why she is coming up here.
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0041.wav,Meanwhile I'll go out to breathe a spell.
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0042.wav,How could he explain his possession of the sketch.
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0043.wav,It seemed nearer to him since he had seen and talked with Gregson.
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0044.wav,Her own betrayal of herself was like tonic to Philip.
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0045.wav,He moved away as quietly as he had come.
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0046.wav,"The girl faced him, her eyes shining with sudden fear."
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0047.wav,Close beside him gleamed the white fangs of the wolf-dog.
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0048.wav,He looked at the handkerchief more closely.
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0049.wav,Gregson was asleep when he re-entered the cabin.
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0050.wav,In spite of their absurdity the words affected Philip curiously.
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0051.wav,"The lace was of a delicate ivory color, faintly tinted with yellow."
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0052.wav,It was a curious coincidence.
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0053.wav,Suddenly his fingers closed tightly over the handkerchief.
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0054.wav,There was nothing on the rock.
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0055.wav,"Philip stood undecided, his ears strained to catch the slightest sound."
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0056.wav,Pearce's little eyes were fixed on him shrewdly.
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0057.wav,"I have no idea, replied Philip."
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0058.wav,I came for information more out of curiosity than anything else.
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0059.wav,His immaculate appearance was gone.
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0060.wav,"Anyway, no one saw her like that."
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0061.wav,Philip snatched at the letter which Gregson held out to him.
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0062.wav,The men stared into each other's face.
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0063.wav,"Yes, it was a man who asked, a stranger."
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0064.wav,The fourth and fifth days passed without any developments.
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0065.wav,They closed now until his fingers were like cords of steel.
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0066.wav,He saw Jeanne falter for a moment.
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0067.wav,"Surely I will excuse you, she cried."
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0068.wav,In a flash Philip followed its direction.
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0069.wav,It was his intention to return to Eileen and her father.
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0070.wav,He would first hunt up Gregson and begin his work there.
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0071.wav,What was the object of your little sensation.
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0072.wav,But who was Eileen's double.
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0073.wav,"The promoter's eyes were heavy, with little puffy bags under them."
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0074.wav,"And now, down there, Eileen was waiting for him."
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0075.wav,"There has been a change, she interrupted him."
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0076.wav,The gray eyes faltered; the flush deepened.
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0077.wav,"It is the fire, partly, she said."
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0078.wav,"Then, and at supper, he tried to fathom her."
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0079.wav,It was a large canoe.
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0080.wav,What if Jeanne failed him.
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0081.wav,What if she did not come to the rock.
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0082.wav,His face was streaming with blood.
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0083.wav,A shadow was creeping over Pierre's eyes.
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0084.wav,Scarcely had he uttered the name when Pierre's closing eyes shot open.
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0085.wav,A trickle of fresh blood ran over his face.
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0086.wav,Death had come with terrible suddenness.
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0087.wav,"Philip bent lower, and stared into the face of the dead man."
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0088.wav,"He made sure that the magazine was loaded, and resumed his paddling."
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0089.wav,The nightglow was treacherous to shoot by.
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0090.wav,The singing voice approached rapidly.
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0091.wav,His blood grew hot with rage at the thought.
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0092.wav,"He went down in midstream, searching the shadows of both shores."
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0093.wav,For a full minute he crouched and listened.
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0094.wav,He had barely entered this when he saw the glow of a fire.
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0095.wav,A big canvas tent was the first thing to come within his vision.
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0096.wav,Perhaps she had already met her fate a little deeper in the forest.
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0097.wav,Then you can arrange yourself comfortably among these robes in the bow.
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0098.wav,Shall I carry you.
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0099.wav,A maddening joy pounded in his brain.
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0100.wav,"You must sleep, he urged."
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0101.wav,"You, you would not keep the truth from me."
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0102.wav,He will follow us soon.
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0103.wav,But there came no promise from the bow of the canoe.
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0104.wav,She was sleeping under his protection as sweetly as a child.
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0105.wav,"Only, it is so wonderful, so almost impossible to believe."
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0106.wav,The emotion which she had suppressed burst forth now in a choking sob.
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0107.wav,If you only could know how I thank you.
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0108.wav,He waded into the edge of the water and began scrubbing himself.
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0109.wav,Do you know that you are shaking my confidence in you.
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0110.wav,"Much, replied Jeanne, as tersely."
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0111.wav,"Instead, he joined her; and they ate like two hungry children."
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0112.wav,He was wounded in the arm.
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0113.wav,I suppose you picked that lingo up among the Indians.
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0114.wav,Her words sent a strange chill through Philip.
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0115.wav,He had no excuse for the feelings which were aroused in him.
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0116.wav,Was it the rendezvous of those who were striving to work his ruin.
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0117.wav,"She added, with genuine sympathy in her face and voice."
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0118.wav,Pierre obeys me when we are together.
data_kevin_16k\data_kevin\arctic_a0119.wav,Jeanne was turning the bow shoreward.
